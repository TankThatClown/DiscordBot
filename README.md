Personal Project "DiscordBot" made by TankThatClown  
Utilized the Discord JS API and MYSQL API to create a functional discord bot that:  
managed the level and activity of each user in my server(Note this bot was intended to only be used by me on my personal server)  
Using MYSQl and database to store information about each user on the server.  
Customized commands that perform certain functions on the server.  
Utilized CSV parser to read a CSV file containing most if not all profanity words and will delete the message if it contains any of the blacklisted word.
